    \brief Provides access to a group of configuration values

    ConfigurationGroup provides access to a group of DConf key values relative to \l path.
    ConfigurationGroups can be nested in which case \l path is relative to the parent
    ConfigurationGroup.

    Key values can be accessed using the \l value() and \l setValue() methods. Value change
    notifications are via the \l valueChanged and \l valuesChanged signals.

    Properties declared on the ConfigurationGroup will be synchronized with DConf keys with the same
    name. Due to the requirement that QML properties start with a lower case letter this method does
    not allow accessing all possible key values. The \l value() and \l setValue() methods can be
    used in these cases.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool ConfigurationGroup::synchronous

    This property holds whether synchronous access is used.

    Defaults to false.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string ConfigurationGroup::path

    This property holds the path of the configuration group. If this ConfigurationGroup is nested
    within another ConfigurationGroup then \c path is relative to the \c path of the parent group.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty ConfigurationGroup ConfigurationGroup::scope

    This property holds the parent scope of the configuration group. The \l path property is
    relative to the \c path of the parent scope.

    This property is automatically set when creating nested ConfigurationGroups.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod variant ConfigurationGroup::value(string key, variant defaultValue, int typeHint)

    Returns the value of \a key as a variant. If \a key does not exist \a defaultValue will be
    returned. If specified, the key value will be converted to the meta type id \a typeHint.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod void ConfigurationGroup::setValue(string key, variant value)

    Sets the value of \a key to \a value.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod void ConfigurationGroup::sync()

    Forces any pending writes to be synchronized with the backing store.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod void ConfigurationGroup::clear()

    Clears all values for properties in this configuration group.
*/

/*!
    \qmlsignal ConfigurationGroup::valueChanged(key)

    This signal is emitted when the value of \a key changes.
*/

/*!
    \qmlsignal ConfigurationGroup::valuesChanged()

    This signal is emitted when unknown properties of this configuration group change.
